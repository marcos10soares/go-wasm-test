# go-wasm-test

Golang webassembly experiment, the project idea was to call golang functions from JS, the ideal test candidate for this project was the pkg `zxcvbn` which has different implementations with different results depending on the language that's implemented with ([issue: Score deviates from the coffee/javascript version](https://github.com/nbutton23/zxcvbn-go/issues/20)). As IMO the golang [zxcvbn-go](https://github.com/nbutton23/zxcvbn-go) pkg has the best implementation and results, the idea was to allow the frontend to use the exact pkg to avoid discrepancies between frontend and backend password strength score.

WASM Browser support: [https://caniuse.com/wasm](https://caniuse.com/wasm)


## Building
```bash
GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o assets/zxcvbn.wasm cmd/zxcvbn/main.go
```


## Serving the files

```bash
cd assets
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

and visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

### Notes:

The file `wasm_exec.js` is copied directly from GO root by doing:
```bash
cp "$(go env GOROOT)/misc/wasm/wasm_exec.js" ./assets/
```

This is the code block responsible for fetching and exectuing the wasm binary:
```javascript
const go = new Go();
WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch("zxcvbn.wasm"), go.importObject).then((result) => {
    go.run(result.instance);
});
```

After running this code block, you can access the golang methods from JS.
